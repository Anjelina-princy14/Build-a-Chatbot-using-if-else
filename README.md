Task 8 – Rule-Based Chatbot (PythonGenie)**

📌 **Overview**

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot created using Python.
It interacts with the user through text input and responds using predefined rules.
The chatbot’s name is **PythonGenie**, a friendly assistant built to demonstrate basic NLP concepts.

---

🚀 **Features**

* Greets the user
* Introduces itself (PythonGenie)
* Provides internship-related information
* Shares course details
* Gives help/options
* Responds to thanks
* Handles unknown inputs
* Exits when the user types *bye/exit/quit*

---

🧩 **How It Works**

1. User types something
2. The chatbot reads and cleans the text
3. It checks for keywords using **if–elif–else**
4. Generates a matching response
5. Continues chatting until “bye” or “exit”

This shows the foundation of **rule-based NLP** without using external libraries.
